# CYW43439-Micropython-Driver
A driver for CYW43439 (Pico Pi W) completely in Micropython

Collated from information found on google and in a variety of repositories on github.   
All code is original based on these sources.  
Also includes some investigatory work on how access to the CWY43439 works from the SPI layer up.  

Really useful sources. 
Most only talk about getting WIFI to work, and bluetooth is an additional set of code.
